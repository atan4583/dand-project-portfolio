## Project Deliverables Summary
### 1. [Explore Weather Trends](https://github.com/atan4583/dand-project-portfolio/tree/master/Project%201-Explore%20Weather%20Trends)
> * Analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends in my home city to overall global temperature trends.
>
>
> * Produced a visualization and prepared a report describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends of my home city.
>
>
> * Tool used: Excel, Jupyter Notebook (Python)
>
>
> * Programming libraries used: pandas, matplotlib
>
>
> * Artifacts: Project 1-Explore Weather Trends.xlsx, Project 1-Explore Weather Trends (Global vs Multi-City).ipynb

### 2. [Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/atan4583/dand-project-portfolio/tree/master/Project%202-Investigate%20a%20Dataset)
> * Analyzed a [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments) containing 100k medical appointments in Brazil, to examine the data characteristics and deduce what are the major factors behind the no show of patients
>
>
> * Documented the analysis process along with visualizations to explain the findings and support the conclusions drawn.
>
>
> * Tool used: Jupyter Notebook (Python)
>
>
> * Programming libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
>
>
> * Artifact: Project 2-Investigate a Dataset.ipynb

### 3. [Analyze A/B Test Results](https://github.com/atan4583/dand-project-portfolio/tree/master/Project%203-Analyze%20AB%20Test%20Results)
> * Use the knowledge gained from the lessons in Practical Statistics, analyzed the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to determine if the company should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
>
>
> * Analysis was conducted using 3 approaches - probabilistic reasoning, hypothesis testing and logistic regression to cross examine the results produced and draw conclusions.
>
>
> * Tool used: Jupter Notebook (Python)
>
>
> * Programming libraries used: panda, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels
>
>
> * Artifact: Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb
