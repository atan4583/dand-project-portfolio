    "#### So what is performance of the image classifier afterall ?\n",

    "##### Well, the `dog` and `hybrid` share the same rating of 13 while the `not dog` has a rating of 10, which rank 4th and 2nd respectively in the top 10 dog ratings. Both the `dog` and `hybrid` are actually Labrador Retriever which ranks 3rd in the top 10 dog breeds. The `not dog` was misclassified but is actually a Spanish Water Dog, though the breed is not among the top 10 dog breeds. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### So of the 1971 entries in the `twitter_archive_master` dataset, 305 entries were misclassified as `not dog`, 472 as `hybrid` (i.e. `may be dog`). Only 1194 were correctly classified as `dog` yet none attains the highest p1 predection of 1. Ironically, the `not dog` has the highest prediction confidence of 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### The numbers represent a 60.58% (=1194/1971 x 100%) chance the model correctly identifies a dog as a dog. Obviously, the model has more room for improvement. "
